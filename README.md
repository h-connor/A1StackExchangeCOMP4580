### About

This application is implemented as a web app using HTML/CSSS/JS and JQuery. 

We use an http request using stack exchanges API to retrieve all information about the most recent and voted question based on the tag inputted by the user.

Casting the result as a JSON object, the requests are then merged, and parsed to the results shown on the website as collapsibles.
